OK, you're all set! Your core bot files are in the current directory.

Before you begin, install your dependencies:
`npm install`

Your bot's already prepared for battle! First, open a new console and run the server locally:
    git clone https://github.com/dramamine/Pokemon-Showdown.git
    npm run server

Run this command to play against your first opponent:

`npm start -- --opponent=randumb`

Other useful commands:
`npm run start:quick`: run with babel-node (skips transpiling step)

`npm run develop`: watch src folder, compile on changes and re-run main.js
(can be used with other flags, ex. `npm run develop -- --opponent=randumb`)

`npm start -- --production`: connect to metal-heart.org.psim.us

`npm start -- --help`: full list of commands for leftovers-again
